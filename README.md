I2P Profile Configuring Launcher for Firefox, Multiplatform
===========================================================

Configures a Firefox profile in the working directory with extensions and 
configuration settings for I2P. At this time, it is configured for mixed I2P
and clearnet browsing via my browser plugin. In the near future, other plugins
may be configured as well as additional settings in user.js
